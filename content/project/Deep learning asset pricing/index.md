 Design and implement two online courses on the EduCoder platform, which by April 2019 has nearly 30,000 registered users from 605 universities:<br>
 1). Developed 3 different deep learning networks (FFN\RNN\GAN) by PyTorch and compared the performance of differnet
models in Predictive and variation explaining ability<br>
 2). Our GAN neural network is constructed using the idea of SDF and GMM method<br>
 3). Discovered annual out of sample Sharpe Ratio of GAN is around 2.6 and twice as high as with the simple forecasting approach FFN
