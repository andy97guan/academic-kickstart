I am currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s degree in Mathematical Finance at Boston University. Personally I am a diligent, proactive, motivated, and result-oriented person, who enjoys working in a fast-paced and team-oriented environment. I am actively looking for a quantitative analyst and data analyst internship in the United States currently.

Through my graduate and undergraduate studies, I have familiarized myself with SQL, R, Python, MATLAB, and Tableau. I am also quite proficient in time series analysis, regression analysis, simulation analysis, data visualization, and machine learning, etc.

Besides my solid academic background in Computational and Applied Mathematics, I have greatly sharpened my professional skills through my diverse internship experience. As a quantitative intern, I gained rich experience in quantitative strategy planning, back-testing system, and statistical modeling. Moreover, as a corporate debt intern, I also strengthened myself in data visualization, advanced analytic trading, and debt/equity market processing.

I am willing to improve myself by doing some projects in the finance and data fields to accumulate enough experience. My bilingual experience enables me to work in a cross-cultural environment. I can be reached either through this profile, by phone at (857) 313-9378 or by email at andy97guan@gmail.com. Please check the additional qualifications below.
